# DotfilesAndStuffV2

## Intro

This repository contains two categories of files:
- Various dotfiles with my personal configuration for vim, neovim, tmux, alacritty, zsh and others.
- Several installation scripts that are suitable for Ubuntu and Manjaro Linux distributions.
Scripts are meant to make development machine bring up process easier.
Scripts are separated in several different files, offering programmer several different layers of installed packages.
What you don't need you don't install.

## New machine setup

1. Run `place_dots.sh` in `dotfiles` folder.
2. Run all numbered scripts in `installation_scripts` folder in ascending order starting with `0_base_system_packages`.
You will be prompted for sudo password.
